The aim of this assignment is twofold. First to model
planning problems in PDDL/HDDL to then invoke a state
of the art planner as those provided by planutils [5]
or manually compiled (e.g., fast downward [2], or
optic [1]). Second, to see how a temporal planning model
could be integrated within a robotic setting leveraging
the PlanSys2 [4] infrastructure discussed in the lectures
and available at https://github.com/PlanSys2/
ros2_planning_system.
